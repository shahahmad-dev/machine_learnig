algorithm** used for **classification tasks**.\n","It is called “Naive” because it **assumes that all features are independent** of each other — which is a simplification, but it works surprisingly well in practice ✅.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Key Points**\n","\n","1. **Probabilistic Model** 📊\n","\n","   * It calculates the probability of each class based on the features.\n","   * Predicts the class with **highest probability**.\n","\n","2. **Types of Naive Bayes**:\n","\n","   * **GaussianNB** → For numeric data (like age, salary)\n","   * **MultinomialNB** → For count data (like word counts in text)\n","   * **BernoulliNB** → For binary features (yes/no, 0/1)\n","\n","3. **Advantages** ✅\n","\n","   * Very fast and simple\n","   * Works well with large datasets\n","   * Performs surprisingly well even if the independence assumption is not true\n","\n","4. **Disadvantages** ⚠️\n","\n","   * Assumes feature independence (not always true)\n","   * Doesn’t capture interactions between features\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Example Use Case**\n","\n","* Email **spam detection** 📨\n","* Job salary classification 💼\n","* Text sentiment analysis 😀😡\n","\n","---\n","- **GaussianNB** → numeric features ke liye best\n","- **MultinomialNB** → text/count features ke liye\n","- **BernoulliNB** → binary features ke
